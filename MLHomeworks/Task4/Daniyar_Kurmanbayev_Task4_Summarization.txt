Best summary:
What I was actually doing here was teaching her neural network (brain) the features of a lion like exactly how Machine Learning Engineers would train the machine to learn new features.
After telling her the features of a lion, asked her “Can you draw these for me?” She happily drew almost a similar figure to that of a dog she drew before.
A dog will have features like face, body, legs, and tail.
A lion will have features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard.
Her neural network got aligned with classifying Dogs and Lions after some training.
Do you know what is the difference between a lion and a dog?” She said, “Yes.” I said, “This is called Learning.
How you learnt it is because of Neural Network inside your brain.
” Now, a neural network is a collection of neurons that keeps switching on and off based on things you see, feel, hear and think just like switching on light bulb at our home.
For example, when I showed you a lion picture, your brain asked the neurons who had seen it before.
The neurons grouped together with features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard forms a lion.
Once all the features are there, the neurons will send a signal that the picture you are looking at is a lion and not a dog.
Every neuron will tune itself to pick up certain features like legs, tail, face, beard, and so on.
Ultimately, the neurons in your brain tell that it is a lion and not a dog.
In a few milliseconds, your brain identifies whether the picture is a lion or a dog.
Tanishi: Neurons\nWhen I ask you to draw a dog, what are the features there?
Tanishi: Yes. Me: So, for a dog, the features are face, body, legs and tail.
If I ask you to draw a lion, what are the features?
Once the features are seen and a logical connection is established, neurons signals your brain that it is a lion.
Tanishi: Neurons
All neurons work together like your friends and identify lion and dog.
Neural network is a group of neuron friends identifying lions and dogs.

Summa summary

Why?
I used all ROUGE, METEOR and BLEU scores to evaluate the score.
I calculated the mean of all 3 scores and got combined score.

These are results:
Summa: 0.2347616397490994
Luhn: 0.17711193590670785
Text Rank: 0.1682506125676474
LSA: 0.12840955522920816
Gensim: 0.09647054815850957
Lex Rank: 0.09441160619858835

So Summa has the highest score

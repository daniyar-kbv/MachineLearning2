Papa, What is a Neural Network?At the back of my head, thoughts of me taking days to comprehend what a NN (short for Neural Network) is, how it would work, where it is used, how it is simulating our human brain’s inner workings were going through.
How you learnt it is because of Neural Network inside your brain.” Now, a neural network is a collection of neurons that keeps switching on and off based on things you see, feel, hear and think just like switching on light bulb at our home.
Every neuron is waiting for your eyes to see something new, for your nose to smell something new, for your ears to hear something new, for your tongue to taste something new.
When something new is heard, or smelled, or seen, or tasted, the neurons will group together to send signals and forms connections with already seen, heard, tasted or smelled neurons.
When you see a new object, your brain will ask the neurons, ‘Hey, anybody experienced this before?’ The neurons will say, ‘Yes, I have seen this.’ Certain other neurons will say, ‘No, I have not seen this.’ The neurons that have seen this before, will group together and form logical connections from the past and gives us an object from our memory.

Summarizer:
LuhnSummarizer

Why?
Because after reading this summary you understand more about the article, I would say it really has key sentences.
Also all the sentences are independent and doesn't need the context to understand it. Other summaries had sentences that were took out of context and didn't make any sense.
Summa summarizer better described the text, but it is twice bigger than LuhnSummarizer's summary. Gensim is also good, but only if word count is huge.
So I think LuhnSummarizer made short, clear and informative summary.

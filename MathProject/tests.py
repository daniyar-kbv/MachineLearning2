fake_new1 = 'Putting a Viral Video Clip of Biden in Context. Conservative personalities are sharing a brief video clip showing Joe Biden speaking at an event in September to suggest the Democratic presidential nominee was making a racially insensitive remark. But it misleadingly omits any context for the quote. A short video clip of former Vice President Joe Biden is circulating on social media, but it misleadingly omits any context for Biden’s words. The 10-second clip shows Biden only saying, “They’re saying, ‘Jeez, the reason I was able to stay sequestered in my home is because some black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf. Biden did say those words during a Sept. 15 event with veterans in Florida. But the full context of his remarks indicates he was suggesting that Americans are becoming more aware and realizing “we’re all in this together” during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also expressed gratitude for such essential workers. Here’s a more complete look at what Biden said before and after the quote in question: Biden, Sept. 15: I am, ironically, more optimistic about the prospects of dealing with the problems we talked about today, as well as so many other problems we have right now, than I’ve ever been in my whole career. And they say, “Well, why in the hell would you say that Biden? You just talked about all these difficulties.” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because the American public, the blinders have been taken off. They’ve all of a sudden seen a hell of a lot clearer. They’re saying, “Jeez, the reason I was able to stay sequestered in my home is because some black woman was able to stack the grocery shelf.” Or “I got a young Hispanic is out there, these dreamers are out there, 60,000 of them acting as first responders and nurses and docs.” Or all of a sudden people are realizing, “My Lord, these people have done so much. Not just black, white, across the board, have done so much for me. We can do this. We can get things done.” And I think they’re ready. And the irony of all ironies is that I think it’s the vehicle by which we’re going to be able to create really good paying jobs. We’re going to be able to provide for significant healthcare. The idea that in the middle of a pandemic, the worst thing since the great flu back in the turn of the century, where so many people died worldwide, is that, you know, people are figuring out that we’re all in this together. We can get through this if we just level with one another. Just tell the truth, let people know. The short, out-of-context clip was amplified on Twitter by a contributor for the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, among others. On Facebook, a columnist for the Patriot Post shared a video of the remark repeating in a loop and wrote, “Biden has #TheHelp who he calls ‘some black woman’ SMH!” In addition to the video clip, the same select quote has been shared in text form on social media. Some of the posts sharing the clip attempted to tie it to a comment Biden made in May, when he said, “If you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.” Biden later apologized for that comment. Here’s a video of the veterans event Biden participated in; the video begins at the relevant timestamp.'
fake_new2 = 'Fake Coronavirus Cures, Part 2: Garlic Isn’t a ‘Cure’. Online posts have claimed to reveal various “cures” for the new coronavirus. Some are benign, like eating boiled garlic, while others are potentially dangerous, like drinking chlorine dioxide, an industrial bleach. Neither will cure the virus. Treatments billed as miracle cures have cropped up across the internet since the new coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan, China, at the end of December. One rumor claims that consuming garlic will treat the illness, which the World Health Organization has now named COVID-19. Another says loading up on vitamin C will do the trick. Yet another would have people, essentially, drink bleach. None of these will treat or cure the virus. We’re addressing each of these claims in separate articles. Here, we examine the claim that boiled garlic will “cure” the virus. A recipe circulating on social media is spreading this false information: “Good news, Wuhan’s corona virus can be cured by one bowl of freshly boiled garlic water. Old Chinese doctor has proven it’s efficacy.  Many patients has also proven this to be effective. Eight (8) cloves of chopped garlics add seven (7)cups of water and bring to boil.,  Eat and drink the boiled garlic water, overnight improvement and healing. Glad to share this.” More important than the typos in the post is the bogus claim that consuming garlic can treat a virus that has killed 1,018 people, as of Feb. 11. There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments that are recommended to prevent or treat the new coronavirus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Patients, however, can receive supportive care to treat their symptoms. But the claim about garlic has spread widely enough that the WHO knocked it down, saying on a webpage dedicated to rumors about the virus: “Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.” Garlic has a reputation for being antimicrobial and antiviral, according to a systematic review cited by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, which researches alternative medicine. But that review included only one trial and found that there was insufficient evidence that garlic could prevent or treat a common cold, according to the NCCIH. It is generally safe to eat garlic in the amount usually found in food, according to the NCCIH. But garlic supplements could increase the risk of bleeding for those taking blood thinners, and garlic can interfere with the effectiveness of some drugs. The center recommends consulting a doctor before using alternative medicines.

fake_new3 = 'No, Wisconsin Did Not Count More Votes Than Registered Voters in 2020. On Nov. 4, 2020, as several states continued to count votes in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, a rumor went viral on social media holding that Wisconsin had counted more votes (3,239,920) than it had registered voters (3,129,000). On Twitter, one user claimed that this was clear evidence of fraud: The claim made in this tweet is false. Wisconsin has not counted more votes than it has registered voters. This tweet is comparing the vote count from 2020 with the number of registered voters from 2018. When we take a look at Wisconsin’s current total of registered voters, we see that there is nothing fraudulent about the state’s count. According to the Wisconsin Election Commission, the “State of Wisconsin had 3,684,726 active registered voters on November 1, 2020.” It’s unclear where the “3,239,920” number shown in the above-displayed tweet comes from. As of this writing, The New York Times reports that a total of “3,296,836” votes have been cast in Wisconsin. In either case, the number of votes counted does not exceed the number of registered voters. So where did the “3,129,000 registered voters” statistic come from? The 2018 midterms. According to data from the United States Census Bureau concerning “Voting and Registration in the Election of November 2018,” Wisconsin had 3,129,000 registered voters in 2018. '
real_new1 = 'British Columbia: Petrol rations after Canada storm. A Canadian province is rationing petrol over fuel shortage fears after a major storm cut off road and rail links. Canadian Armed Forces personnel have begun arriving in British Columbia to help with recovery efforts in the flood-stricken region. On Friday the province issued travel restrictions and rations on petrol, just a few days after declaring a state of emergency. At least one person has been confirmed dead, but more deaths are expected. British Columbia Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth said non-essential traffic would be restricted while they rebuild the highway network. Fearing a fuel shortage, he called on people only to fill their vehicles with 30 litres per trip to the petrol station until 1 December. He did not say how close the province was to running out of gas, and said he would not send police to enforce the ration. "It’s 10 to 11 days where we have to pull together as a province, if were greedy, we’ll fail," he told media on Friday. "The overwhelming majority of people will do the right thing," he added. With major highways shut and the Canadian Pacific rail line facing multiple track outages, the federal government is looking into alternatives to help supplies flow into the affected area. US border officials have allowed truckers who don’t usually cross the border to access roads so they can deliver supplies, the province says. As of Friday, approximately 14,000 residents were still displaced from their homes. A major agricultural region, almost 1,000 farms are under an evacuation order and thousands of farm animals have already been trapped and killed by the floods. More than 100 soldiers have been deployed to the area so far and more stand by. Helicopters stationed on Vancouver Island and other’s parts of British Columbia might also be called on to ferry supplies and emergency personnel or evacuate residents. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to "to do more to help people directly." Plans to build a 2.5 km levee were scrapped in favour of building a dike. Heavy rains are expected to sweep through the area next week. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Abbotsford mayor Henry Braun said that water levels are still rising in several areas near the town. "We are not out of this thing by a long shot," Mr Braun said. He estimated that repairing Abbotsford after the storm may cost up to C$1bn ($790m, £590m).'
real_new2 = 'The ’Biden 2024’ debate is a straight-up loser for Democrats (CNN)Joe Biden is less than a year into his presidency and already his party is fractured over the question of whether he will -- or should -- run again in 2024. "Biden and aides tell allies he is running in 2024 amid growing Democratic fears," reads the headline of a Washington Post story detailing the machinations over whether the 79-year-old President is, in fact, planning to run again. (My favorite part of the Post story is that after assurance after assurance that Biden is in fact running, they drop this quote: "One Democrat involved in campaigns said they couldn’t think of a single person they had spoken to in the last month who considers the possibility of Biden running again to be a real one.") On Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki doubled down on Biden’s plans to run telling reporters on Monday, "Yes, that’s his intention." The is-he-or-isn’t-he news cycle comes hard on the heels of a series of stories -- led by this one on CNN -- detailing growing concerns over how Vice President Kamala Harris is handling the job of vice president and whether she really will be the frontrunner many expected her to be whenever Biden does step aside. Add it up and you get a whole lot of nerves and confusion -- all for an election that is almost three years away. And, at root, these stories raise two questions. There’s the obvious one: Is Biden, who will be almost 82 by Election Day 2024, going to run again? And the less obvious one: Is a Biden 2024 candidacy the best thing for the Democratic Party’s chances at holding the White House? The first question is utterly unknowable. I assume Biden hasn’t even considered making a decision about it yet. The second question is more interesting to me -- since it speaks to where Democrats think they are and what they need. On the one hand, Biden would be running in 2024 as an incumbent -- almost always a good thing -- and a known commodity to the public. That, plus Harris’ struggles to adapt to the VP role, suggest Biden may well be the party’s best choice. On the other, Biden’s approval rating is stuck in the low 40s. He has struggled to bridge the divide between the liberal and moderate wings of the party. And again, he will be in his early 80s when his first term ends. It’s clear from the Post story -- as well as all the handwringing around Harris -- that Democrats are divided on whether Biden runs again, and whether that is a good thing for the party.'
real_new3 = 'Parliament returns today with a familiar seat map but a new set of challenges. The House of Commons will reconvene today after a hiatus of nearly five months — a period punctuated by an election campaign that returned a seat map that looks very much like the one from the last session of Parliament. The first order of business today is electing a Speaker to preside over the chamber’s proceedings. Government House Leader Mark Holland told CBC News that after that vote, the next priorities are reconstituting the hybrid model that allows MPs to dial in from outside Ottawa and enforcing a new vaccine mandate for parliamentarians. The vaccine mandate is contentious already. After weeks of non-answers and threats of a challenge to the new vaccination rules, Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole confirmed to Radio-Canada over the weekend that all Conservative MPs are now either vaccinated or have secured a medical exemption to the requirement. O’Toole refused to say just how many of his caucus colleagues have been able to bypass the vaccine mandate by claiming an exemption. According to the Board of Internal Economy (BOIE), the committee of MPs that essentially governs the House, an MP can be exempted if they have proof of "a medical contraindication to full vaccination." "All of our MPs will be there," O’Toole said in French. "For me, it is not appropriate to speak about the specific health issues of another MP." O’Toole, who is facing an organized challenge to his leadership in the form of a petition from a now former caucus colleague, said he convinced the holdouts to get a shot or produce papers to show why they can’t. "I said we had to follow the rules and it’s important for leaders to set an example. And I am satisfied with the approach of our team after the election," he said in an interview with Les coulisses du pouvoir. Holland said the Conservatives are usually sticklers for Commons rules and he expects it to be no different with vaccination. "I harken back to how many times I’ve seen Conservative members stand up and demand the Speaker not allow a member to speak because they’re not wearing a tie. They’re very adherent to the rules inside the chamber so I’m hoping they’re equally respectful of this," he said. "This is not a matter of conscience. It’s demonstrated by science that it’s not safe to have unvaccinated members in the parliamentary precinct." Holland is also insisting on a hybrid Parliament where some MPs are physically present in the Commons while others speak and vote remotely. When the House was dissolved before the September election, the last hybrid agreement ended. Holland wants the dual format to continue until at least June 2022. "It’s absolutely imperative we continue with this and the flexibility it provides," he said. "I don’t want to be coming back in March re-litigating all of this, wasting precious House time."'
real_new4 = 'As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip their fiscal script. The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid.
